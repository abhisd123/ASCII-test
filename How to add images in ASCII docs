= How to Add Images in AsciiDoc

:imagesdir: /D:/ASCII document exercise

== Introduction

This guide explains how to efficiently add images in AsciiDoc (.adoc) files using proper syntax and best practices.

== Step-by-Step Instructions

=== 1. Basic Image Syntax

Use the following syntax to include an image:
// The square brackets are used to add code snippets where the language is defined after the comma.
[source,asciidoc]
----
image::path/to/image.png[Alt Text, width=600, height=400]
----

- `image::` is the directive to include an image.
- `path/to/image.png` is the relative or absolute path to the image file.
- `[Alt Text, width=600, height=400]` is the optional attributes block.

=== 2. Use Relative Paths

Organize your images in a dedicated folder and use relative paths:
// A relative path is the path of the directory where the image is saved in relation to the path where the document file is saved. The ".." signs for going to a different folder titled "images" and then fetching the image 'example.png'
[source,asciidoc]
----
image::..images/example.png[Example Image]
----

=== 3. Set Image Attributes

You can control the size and alignment of the image:

[source,asciidoc]
----
image::images/example.png[Example Image, width=500, align=center]
----

=== 4. Inline Images

For small icons or logos, use inline image syntax:

[source,asciidoc]
----
image:images/logo.png[Logo, width=50]
----

=== 5. Set Image Directory

To simplify image paths, set the `imagesdir` attribute at the top of your document:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:imagesdir: images
----

Then you can reference images like this:

[source,asciidoc]
----
image::example.png[Example Image]
----

== Best Practices

* Use descriptive alt text for accessibility.
* Keep image file names meaningful and consistent.
* Use relative paths to ensure portability.
* Set `:imagesdir:` to avoid repeating folder paths.
* Test rendering in your target output format (HTML, PDF, etc.).

Example:
image: Images/Pig_lifecycle.png[Pig lifecycle, width=500, align=center]


== Conclusion

AsciiDoc provides a powerful and flexible way to include images in your documentation. Follow these steps and best practices to ensure your images are displayed correctly and consistently.
